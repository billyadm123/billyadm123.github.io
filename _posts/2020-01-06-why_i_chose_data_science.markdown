When I was five years old I had two strokes.  Ever since then I have never felt a strong connnection to other people.  People have always said the word "No" to me like, "No, we don't want your help", or "No, you'll just get in the way."  I always felt that I got in the way or no one wnted to deal with me because of my disabilities. This made me isolate myself from people and I would spend a lot of time alone.  Even though I never felt connected with people, I did feel a strong connection to all animals.  An animal won't treat you any different if you have a disability or not.


# **Choosing the wrong major in college**
When I went off to college, I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life.  In high school I didn't take my schooling as seriously as I should of and didn't do as well as I could of.  Unfortunately this pattern continued into college.  I chose to major in homeland security, I guess I have always been interested in that but my true passion was working with animals. Like high school, my academic performance in college wasn't where it could of been. During my last year of college I was looking online and I heard about the poaching crisis in Africa.  As I started digging deeper I realized not only what a huge problem poaching was but also the humanitarian crisis in Africa.  I started thinking more about how I could use my degree and my love of animals to help out.


# **My life-changing trip**
After college, because I didn't do so hot and it was difficult for me to find employment, I didn't know where to begin in my plan to get to Africa to help out.  My parents told me that for a graduation present we could either go on a cruise or some other trip.  I was looking online for trips to take and I didn't want to do the typical Florida trip or the Carribean, I already been to those places.  I found a volunteer placement in Africa helping care for lions.  I emailed them before I told anyone I knew.  They emailed me back and said there would be no prpblem with me coming to volunteer(I was a little shocked after hearing "No" from so many people before).  I told my mom first and she was on board and then I told the rest of the family.

This trip confirmed to me that working in the conservation field is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  My trip mostly was focused on the lions. Feeding them, cleaning the enclosures, and doing research on the ones getting ready to be released.  Although wildlife conservation is a big passion of mine and the main focus of this trip, on my birthday I went and volunteered in an clinic in a nearby town.  This was truly an eye opening experience.  People would walk from miles away, usually barefoot, no water, and in the hot sun just to wait in a long line.  I helped record patient vitals with another volunteer who was volunteering on one of the medical projects.  I also was able to take an excursion to Victoria Falls, which is a very touristy place, but there were so many people in the streets who had no many, only one pair of clothes, begging for money or anything we were not using anymore(usually clothes).  At the end of my trip and on the plane ride home, I had a better idea of how I wanted to help.


# **THE PLAN**
Once I got home, I started doing additional volunteering related to animal care.  The next christmas, I got my first drone which made me want to do some research in what kind of jobs there were using them because I loved flying it.  I found that they were being used for anti-poaching and the humanitarian crisis.  I started hearing more about analysis, big data, and machine learning/AI.  I started researching that and seeing all the capabilities of it.  I always wanted to go back to school but money was always an issue, but then I found Flatiron school which had the option of paying nothing upfront.  I told my mom about it and she told me if I was committed to it that I should go for it.  After applying to Flatiron, I went to a leadership workshop in Florida, and after telling them my dream and plan, the guy who ran this workshop told me he wanted to mentor me and I now have an entire team around me and supporting me to get back to Africa.
I plan on started my own drone services company involved with anti-paoching and humanitarian efforts.  I plan on using what I learn in the course to incorporate AI and machine learning to filter through the huge amount of data to make better and more timely decisions and to predict patterns to mitigate or prevent catastrophic events and hopefully save lives.
