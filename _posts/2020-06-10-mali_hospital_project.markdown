**Embrace Relief** and **Project CURE** have partnered together to start the **Mali Hospital Project**.  The projects goal is to *provide essential supplies to the Clinic Gaoussou Fofana and Clinic Planet Vision*. These are the only clinics that serve the people of Mali and with inadequate supplies, they are not able to perform to the best of their abilities.  The two clinics are planning to open six new departments but lack the right equipment to operate safely.  With these new supplies and the expansion of six departments, the clinics will be able to serve more Mali citizens and cover a wider range of diseases, strengthening the healthcare system. Poor healthcare has a wide range of effects on poverty, increasing the vulnerability of certain populations, and making them an easy target to be recruited by crime organizations or terrorist groups, increasing the security threat in an already politically unstable environment.

Three years ago, I had the privilege of traveling to Africa and visiting for three weeks.  Much of my trip was spent at a lion rehabilitation sanctuary that prepared lions raised in captivity to be released back into the wild.  While the focus of the trip was the lion sanctuary, I was able to visit a local clinic in Gweru, Zimbabwe and volunteer there with two other volunteers taking patients vitals.  Right when I arrived at the clinic, I saw how small it was and the long line of people that stretched out the door and down the road. I noticed that about 90 percent of the patients were coming in dehydrated but most, if not all of them did not even realize the because it had become their normal.  I also got to witness some wound cleaning, and the rooms weren’t very clean, and doctors and nurses had to reuse supplies adding risk for infection.

	
#### 	I understand with the distance between the reader of this blog and those people in Africa, you are probably asking yourself, “Why should I care”?  We are all human, we all need help.  There are situations that we can’t always prevent from happening.  But we can alleviate some of the suffering.  We can provide support to those in need.  **We all need to take a stand and be the guardians of the world and to create a brighter future**.
